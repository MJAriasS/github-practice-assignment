# Repository for Lab Assignment (Week 2) github-practice-assignment
This respository is the home for the Lab Assignment in Week 2 of the Biological Data Science (BIOS 4801) class.
This is the README file for my Github Practice Assignment. 
## Goals
My goals for this class are to learn (and re-learn) practices for better data management, version control, reproducibility, and generally to improve my skillset as a scientist and ecologist. My undergraduate background in the humanities strengthened my communication and writing skills, but I lacked some of the computational skills needed for natural science and research. It has been a delightful (and challenging!) learning curve, but as someone who had only used computers for basic word processing and internet browsing, I am very proud of the skills I have acquired in the past few years. I am looking forward to the opportunities for expanding and building on my skillset. 
## Reproducibility 
Learning tool: Reproducibility has already been a helpful learning tool for me, since I was able to access code, comments, and datasets from other researcher's articles and use that to inform my understanding and to even try out similar analyses on my data (crucial for the work I did during my master's degree, which got me in touch with Ben Freeman!)
Credibility: Adhering to standard practices in my field regarding data and code availability will help me as I build my professional career and skillset.
Organization: As a member of a young research lab, I am interested in finding ways to build our database and to craft protocols and practices that will allows us to keep track of projects, ideas, and workflows. I also like that it lets me do version control and keep a log of the changes I make and the reasons. 
### Making a change to a file in testing branch of repository
I am adding this info from the testing branch in the Github browser. I'm a bit confused about the alerts that one branch is x commits ahead or behind the main branch-- I assume those resolve with the pull requests and merging? 
### Collaboration
Robert Ernst has access to repo if he wants to make a change here. I have made an edit on his repository's README file.
