This document is part of the Lab Assignment for Week 2 in the Biological Data Science course. It contains a sample chunk and a code chunk with a simple mathematical operation. 

This week we are practicing creating GitHub repositories, committing, pushing, pulling, branching, and merging.

Important information to include in future analyses: objective of the analyses, what data we are working with and what stage of the analysis we are in.  



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
# this is a simple mathematical operation (step 7 in the worksheet)
5*5
#[1] 25
```
